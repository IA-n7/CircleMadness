# CircleMadness
Circle Madness is a browser game using Javascript and a bit of jQuery.
The objective of the game is to click on as many of the circles as possible.
Time limit is 1 minute, and circles will be generated every second.

## To Be Done
Currently there is no tracking system for persisting scores/high-scores.
Game progression has not been completely finalized, but is in a decent
condition for the moment.
There remains some refactoring and optimizations to be done.
